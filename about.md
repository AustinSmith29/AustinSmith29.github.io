Hello, I'm Austin Smith. I am a Computer Science student at the University
of Florida who decided to start a blog to share all the <strike>lame</strike>
cool stuff I am learning/working on. I am doing this mostly for my benefit so 
that I can look back and check out my progress on the path to programming
nirvana, but I figure if in the off chance someone finds something I have
to say interesting and useful, then that's pretty cool too.

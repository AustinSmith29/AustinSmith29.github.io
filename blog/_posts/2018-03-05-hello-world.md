Ah, how the words "Hello World" fill me with excitement. To me it represents
something new and exciting; it represents something new to be learned.
 How many great programmers of the past and present began their programming 
journeys by displaying these simple words? We all come from humble beginnings,
it is only through hard work and determination that we become great.

This post is my "Hello World" to the world of blogging. This is my blog's
humble beginning. I do not expect this blog to become anything great... 
behind a great blog is a great author, and I certainly do not meet that
criteria. This blog's purpose is more personal. It is going to be a way
for me to view my progress in my journey to become the best programmer I can
be. I think it will be amusing to one day read back through this blog and 
reflect upon my progress. This blog also presents a great platform for me
to organize my thoughts. I find that writing helps organize my mind.

At the same time, if by some miracle someone stumbles across this blog and
actually finds it interesting, I would be delighted if something I wrote
helped someone along on their own journey. So without further ado, let the
journey begin!
